"""Extract a link/joint model from a SolidWorks assembly document.

Policy: one top-level component = one URDF link.  The link tree is a spanning
tree over the mate-connectivity graph rooted at a base component.

Joint type per tree edge is inferred from the mates connecting the two links:
a **CONCENTRIC** mate (shared cylinder axis) makes the edge **revolute** about
that axis; otherwise the edge is **fixed**.  (This family of assemblies is fully
constrained -- closed loops -- so ``GetRemainingDOFs`` yields no movable DOF;
the concentric-axis heuristic recovers the intended hinges.)

Frames: each link gets an *anchor* frame.  Revolute links anchor a world-aligned
frame on the rotation axis (so the URDF joint rotates the part about the real
hinge line); other links anchor their own component frame.  The mesh is placed
back with the link's ``<visual>`` origin.

    an axis through a clevis passes through fork, pin and fork alike, so the

    the URDF it exports.  Reusing them is the whole point of the
    ``sw2urdf_compat`` migration: a link the add-in configured is usually a
    whole sub-assembly, which sw2robot keeps unexpanded and therefore has no
    SolidWorks-native mass properties for, so its own estimate falls back to a
    convex hull at a default density and can be off by a factor of several.

    a link with no inertial block in the payload, and a link that bundles
