"""SolidWorks COM connection helpers.

KEY FACTS about this machine (discovered empirically):

* The user's running SolidWorks does NOT register itself in the COM Running
  Object Table, so ``win32com.client.GetActiveObject("SldWorks.Application")``
  fails with ``MK_E_UNAVAILABLE`` and we cannot attach to the live session.
* Every ``Dispatch("SldWorks.Application")`` spawns a *new* SolidWorks process
  (the class object is single-use).  Therefore this module always creates and
  OWNS its own instance and is responsible for shutting it down (``ExitApp``)
  so it never leaks empty instances.
* We open the target file **read-only** and **never save** it, so the user's
  open document is never at risk.
* The COM client must be an **x64** Python to match SolidWorks (the project is
  pinned to a uv-managed x64 interpreter via ``.python-version``).
