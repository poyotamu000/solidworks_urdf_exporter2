"""Serializable intermediate state (the cached SolidWorks extraction).

`extract` (slow, needs SolidWorks) writes a ``GraphState`` to ``graph.json``
plus the per-component meshes.  Everything after that -- choosing the base,
excluding parts, wiring joints, setting axes/limits/root frame, writing URDF --
operates on this JSON with NO SolidWorks, so iteration is instant.
