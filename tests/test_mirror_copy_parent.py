"""Regression test for the mate-less mirror/copy parent rule.

SolidWorks 'Mirror Components' and pattern copies carry NO mates, so a mirrored
part (e.g. the right gripper finger) reaches the tree builder with nothing to
connect to.  The plain nearest-component fallback then bolts it to whatever
sits closest -- which for a second finger copy is the FIRST finger copy, not
the gripper base, producing a bogus finger-under-finger chain.

The fix: a mate-less part whose twin (another instance of the same part) IS
mated reuses that twin's connection -- it attaches to the nearest already-placed
instance of the twin's parent PART, i.e. it connects exactly like its mirror
original.  A safety guard only fires the rule when the world-nearest instance of
that parent part is already placed, so it can never cross sides (a right finger
onto a left base).
