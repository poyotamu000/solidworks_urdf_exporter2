"""Regression test for the mirror-feature joint-axis fallback.

SolidWorks 'Mirror Components' positions the opposite-hand copies via the mirror
feature, so GetMates returns nothing for them -- the mirrored side (e.g. the
right arm) reaches _config_parent_map with no axis and would build as a dead
fixed link.  When the mirrored child part has exactly one sibling instance whose
joint DOES have an axis (the mated original), the axis -- a feature of that
part, identical in its own frame -- is reflected into the copy's pose:
``ax_R = W_child_R @ W_child_L^-1 @ ax_L``.
